This project, which is close to my heart, is my first website made from scratch. It is simply a portfolio-type site intended to serve as a showcase for a painter.

## The painter
You can check his work on his [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/syhommonde/) or [here](https://moise7000.github.io/syhom-website/) ;)

## How to use ?
If you want to see the website project in your browser do this : 
- clone the project (or get the zip file)
- open the ```news.html``` file in the browser of your choice
