This project that is close to my heart is my first website made from scratch. It is only a portfolio type site intended to be a showcase for a painter.

## How to use ?
If you want to see the website project in your browser do this : 
- clone the project (or get the zip file)
- open the ```news.html``` file in the browser of your choice
